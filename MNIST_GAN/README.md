# MNIST_GAN example
<hr>

## Description

This has been implemented as a proof-of-concept exercise with GAN networks, allowing me to familiarise 
myself the pytorch library and the structure of GANs.

These scripts train a generative network to create examples of hand-drawn numerical digits as demonstrated 
by and learned from the MNIST corpus. 

The results of a 100 epochs of training have been pickled.
